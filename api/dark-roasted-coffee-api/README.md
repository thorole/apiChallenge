## üéØ **YOUR ASSIGNMENT** 
<details>
  <summary><b>üé≠ Backstory</b></summary>

  Ahh, coffee. The universal beverage. In every country on the planet, people drink it. It's one of those special things that binds us together as human beings. No matter the culture we come from. Or the language we speak. Most of us share a common respect for a great cup of coffee. 

  No other beverage has inspired developers more. And so, we dedicate this challenge to coffee. A universal challenge, for a universal beverage.<br>
</details>

<br>

### **Summary**
The front-end team has been hard at work developing the Catalog of the Coffee App. And now, they need an API that provides:
- Coffee Drink **data from the back-end** ‚Äî to render the catalog.

<br>

> üëâ **P.S.** You'll be implementing the API providing this data.

‚û°Ô∏è Handoffs
> **System Architecture**<br>
[Coffee API - OpenAPI Spec File](./specs/CoffeeAPI.yaml) `(the api you'll implement)` <br>*You can find the OpenAPI specification file in the `spec/` folder.*

> **Dummy Data**<br>
[Dummy Data - JSON File](./data/CoffeeData.json) <br>
*You can find the dummy data in the `data/` folder.*

<br>

üìù Acceptance Criteria
- the API is implemented perfectly according to the OpenAPI specification

### **Tasks**
> A breakdown of the assignment into smaller tasks ‚Äî with more details.

- <details><summary><b>Bootstrap Your Project</b> <code>ü™ô3 points</code></summary>
  
  > Bootstrap your project inside the `api/` folder, and use an well-organized folder structure.

  <br>üìù Acceptance Criteria
  > ‚Ä¢ the API project is bootstrapped inside the `api/` folder
  <br>‚Ä¢ a well-organized folder structure is used
  <br></details>

- <details><summary><b>Implement the Coffee API</b> <code>ü™ô8 points</code></summary>
  
  > Implement the `Coffee API`, percisely according to the OpenAPI speficiation.

  The `Coffee API` relies on data about various Coffee Drinks. You can find this data as a json file in the `/data` folder. You need to provide this data through your endpoints.

  **P.S.** _Don't implement a database. It's not needed... yet._ <br>Feel free to follow best practices like the repository pattern to improve code readability, but don't go any further than that.

- <details><summary><b>Write Unit Tests</b> <code>ü™ô7 points</code></summary>
  
  > Write unit tests for the `Coffee API`.
  
  If you don't know where to start, [UnitTest by Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html) is a good resource to check out. Remember, tests should help ensure high quality, make maintenance & refactoring easier, and improve the overall developer experience.

  Make sure to:
  - select & use high quality software testing packages
  - aim for balance - don't test too much, or too little

<br>

### **Quality Assurance**
> In addition to the acceptance criteria associated with each task, there are also overall criteria for **evaluating the quality** of your work & final result. That's what this section is about.

Your solution will be reviewed by professionals, just like it would in a normal day-to-day work situation. Below you can find the criteria specifically related to quality - which together with your task completion will determine your score in the challenge.

- <details><summary><b>Code Readability</b> <code>ü™ô4 points</code></summary>
  
  > is your code easy to understand (i.e. simple naming & syntax) and well presented (i.e. consistent & well documented where needed)?

  Readability is the ease with which a reader can understand your code. In programming, things such as programmer comments, choice of loop structure, and choice of names can determine the ease with which humans can read computer program code.
  <br></details>

- <details><summary><b>Software Package Selection</b> <code>ü™ô5 points</code></summary>
  
  > Have you chosen well-designed _(e.g. easy to use & understand)_ highly adopted _(e.g. big community, common issues raised & resolved already)_ and reliable _(e.g. good performance, well maintained, no security vulnerabilities)_ and otherwise solid `software packages`?

  A `software package` _(accessible through software package managers like `NPM`)_ is a collection of software components which when combined perform a set of generalized tasks that are applicable to a range of use cases. 

  Selecting the right software package can lead to a better developer experience, less maintenance overhead, ease of fixing issues, and avoidance of security vulnerabilities. Selecting the wrong software package can lead to a host of issues, including unforeseen bugs, security vulnerabilities, maintenance nightmares, and much more. All of this makes selecting the right software packages an essential measure of quality.

  <summary><b>‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</b></summary>
  
  > Common questions and answers for getting started quickly.<br>

  <details><summary><b>How do I deliver?</b></summary>
    
  > To deliver your solution you'll have to commit and push the repo, and then go to the DIGGIT dashboard to submit your solution.
  <br></details>

  <details><summary><b>How do I know if I'm ready to submit?</b></summary>
    
  > First, check your tasks. Make sure you have given all of them your best shot. Second, check the quality assurance section. Verify that your solution is high quality by cheking your solution against this section. Once you've done your best, both in terms of tasks & quality, you're ready to submit.
  <br></details>

  <details><summary><b>I'm Stuck... help?!</b></summary>
    
  > Oof... sorry, but we can't do debugging for active challenges. But what we can recommend is that you take some extra time. You may just need to take a break, go have a coffee or take a walk. Or all of the above! We often find it helps to simply take your mind off the problem for a little while... Once you come back, check again your progress on both tasks & quality, and see if there is something you haven't considered or tried before. All we can ask is that you do your best. And regardless of the final result, there's a lot to gain from submitting your solution. We wish you the best of luck!
